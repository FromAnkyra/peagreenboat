# Ratatouille

Everyone tells me i make ratatouille wrong, but it's good and relatively quick. Serve warm with rice or couscous, or serve cold, as a salad or side.

A lot.

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 large onion - (chopped)
- 1 *bulb* of garlic - (peeled, with each clove sliced into wide thin slices)
- 2 sweet peppers - (sliced into long thin slices)
- 1 aubergine - (diced)
- 1 large courgette - (or 2 small)
- 1 can of plum tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon or twig rosemary 
- 1 teaspoon or handful thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- salt 
- pepper
- olive oil
- balsamic vinegar

Method
------

1. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large frying pan or crockpot. Once the oil is hot, add the onions and a large pinch of salt. (the salt helps dehydrate the onions, speeding up the cooking process, and helps conserve the flavour later on). Let cook until the onions are transparent (about 10 mins)
2. Add the garlic, thyme, rosemary, and some pepper. Fry and stir for a minute or so. 
3. Once the garlic is fragrant, add the aubergine, and stir well, so that it's coated in oil. (if there's not enough oil to coat all the aubergine, add more). Let cook with the lid on.
4. After about 5 minutes (the time it takes to chop the courgettes), add the courgettes, mix, and then let them sweat with the lid on for another five minutes. 
5. Add the peppers and mix well, then let the mixture cook until you can cut the aubergine pieces with your spoon. (this may take a while.)
6. Add the canned tomatoes, crushing them with a fork or wooden spoon. Fill the can up to one third with boiling water, then add that too. Add the bay leaf, a swig of balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. 
7. Bring to a simmer and leave it for about half an hour, or until the sauce has reached the desired thickness.

Notes
-----
This recipe is vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. 
I usually cook it in my cast iron pan for maximum flavour. 
I promise I am not joking about the garlic.
